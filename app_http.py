# app_http.py
# Purpose: Wrap the yfinance-mcp server with an HTTP endpoint that MCP clients can reach.
# This uses the official MCP Python SDK's "streamable HTTP" transport.

# Many MCP servers expose a module-level `mcp` FastMCP instance.

# Optional: if you prefer the endpoint to be exactly `/`
# uncomment the next line:

# On Render, the process manager (uvicorn below) will call `app` and bind to $PORT.
